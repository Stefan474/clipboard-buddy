My first attempt for an app that I wanna share with people in React. 

The point of the application is to have different tabs where you can put your clipboard stuff so that people who copy/paste a lot for their job don't have to have a word document open the whole time. Made with mobile first design in mind because its most common use case will be it being stuck to the side with minimum browser width so that all the data is easily accessible with a single click.
